Calories-Burned-Prediction Using Machine Learning. (Regression Use case)
Project Overview
Calorie burn prediction is essential for fitness tracking and can help users better understand their energy expenditure during exercise.
This project leverages a regression model to estimate calorie burn based on user input data, providing a valuable tool for personal health and fitness tracking.
Implemented Machine Algorithms are:
1. Linear Regression
2. DecisionTree Regression
3. RandomForest Regression
4. XGBoost Regressor
